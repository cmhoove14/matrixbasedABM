Average occupancy across all prison facilities was `r round(avg_start)` as of `r min(pop_dat$Date)`, but had decreased to `r round(avg_end)` as of `r (max(pop_dat$Date)-5)`.

Average occupancy across  prison facilities with at least five introductions was `r round(avg_start_g5_ob)` as of `r min(pop_dat_g5_ob$Date)`, but had decreased to `r round(avg_end_g5_ob)` as of `r (max(pop_dat_g5_ob$Date)-5)`.

# Introduction rate  
## All facilities  
```{r intros}
n_days <- length(unique(dat$Date))

n_facs <- length(unique(dat$Facility))

n_intros <- length(unique(outbreaks_df14day$Facility_Outbreak))
```

Across `r n_days` of observation of `r n_facs` facilities, there were `r n_intros` introductions, defined as a new resident case following a 14-day washout period with no resident cases, giving a rate of `r round(n_intros/n_facs/n_days, 3)` introductions per facility per day.

## Facilities shown in figure (with at least five introductions)  
```{r intros_g5_ob}
n_days_g5_ob <- length(unique(dat$Date[which(dat$Facility %in% g5_ob_facs)]))

n_intros_g5_ob <- length(unique(outbreaks_df14day$Facility_Outbreak[which(dat$Facility %in% g5_ob_facs)]))
```

Across `r n_days_g5_ob` of observation of `r n_facs_g5_ob` facilities, there were `r n_intros_g5_ob` introductions, defined as a new resident case following a 14-day washout period with no resident cases, giving a rate of `r round(n_intros_g5_ob/n_facs_g5_ob/n_days_g5_ob, 3)` introductions per facility per day.
